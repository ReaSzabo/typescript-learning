Interfaces are primarily used to define the shape of an object, 
which means they specify what properties and methods an object should have, 
but they don’t provide any actual implementation for those properties and methods. 
Classes, on the other hand, are used to define the behavior and properties of an object, 
and they can include both the interface and the implementation of the object’s methods.
